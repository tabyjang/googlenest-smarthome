## Common Patterns

**Note:** This project currently has no testing infrastructure.

**Recommendations for future testing:**
- Consider adding Vitest (fast, Vite-native test runner)
- Testing Library for React component testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing of 3D interactions

**Critical areas that would benefit from tests:**
- Room planner drag-and-drop interactions
- Product estimation calculations
- API integrations (email sending, AI responses)
- 3D scene rendering and interactions
- Routing and page navigation
